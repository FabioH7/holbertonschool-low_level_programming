# What is C
> C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

## Why learn C?
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
- C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
- C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies


## What is included in this directory?

> This directory includes my journey in learning the C language with Holberton School. Most exercises and topics i have learned in C are explained here! Thank you in advance for taking your time to read them!


#### Check these topics!:

- [argc_argv](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/argc_argv) One of the 2 prototypes of the main function in C!
- [bit_manipulation](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/bit_manipulation) Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte. C language is very efficient in manipulating them!
- [doubly_linked_lists](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/doubly_linked_lists) Doubly linked lists in C are Lists that have pointers to the next and previous element, very interesting topic!
- [file_io](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/file_io) File descriptors are used to open, create, delete files and also to read and write in them
- [function_pointers](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/function_pointers) Function pointers points to code, not data, Cool!
- [functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/functions_nested_loops)  Loops in loops, used to make thigs without writing much, not that efficient!
- [hash_tables](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/hash_tables) Data structure that uses a hash function to get a key index which is used to store the data in the array of linked lists.
- [hello_world](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/hello_world) My introduction to C
- [makefiles](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/makefiles) Used to compile code the way you want
- [malloc_free](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/malloc_free) Probably the best and worst thing at the same time in C, memory allocation!
- [more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_functions_nested_loops) More functions and nested loops
- [more_malloc_free](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_malloc_free) More fun and misery
- [more_singly_linked_lists](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/more_singly_linked_lists) More linking singles to the next single!
- [pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/pointers_arrays_strings) Leaning about pointers arrays and an array of characters!
- [preprocessor](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/preprocessor) One of the 4 stesps of the compiler in C
- [recursion](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/recursion) Can't loop? Use recursion!
- [search_algorithms](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/search_algorithms) Want to search for something? Search here!
- [singly_linked_lists](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/singly_linked_lists) Introduction to lists in C!
- [static_libraries](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/static_libraries) Creating my first static Library!
- [structures_typedef](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/structures_typedef) Learning about structures and typedef!
- [variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variables_if_else_while) Learning about conditions in C
- [variadic_functions](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/main/variadic_functions) argc argv??? Nope
